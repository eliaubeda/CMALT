        <h2>Backgorund, Skills and Experience</h2>
        <p>In January 2022 I joined King’s Online (King’s College London) as an E-Learning Content Developer. This was a career shift for me, with the hope to combine two of my greatest passions: education and technology. Both of these started to take shape back in 2015, when I had my first experience teaching in HE and I became interested in web design and coding.</p>
        <h3>Teaching</h3>
        <p>I have worked in Higher Education since 2015, teaching at the <em>Universitat de Barcelona</em> and The University of York, doing course administration at The London Institute of Banking & Finance and now working at King’s College London.</p>
        <p>I have been a guest lecturer multiple times at the Universitat de Barcelona’s department of History of Art, where I also designed and delivered a Level 5 module in 2021. At The University of York, I worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) from 2017 to 2021 at the departments of Sociology, History of Art, and the Centre for Women’s Studies. During that time I became increasingly interested in pedagogy and became an Associate Fellow of AdvanceHE after doing the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/staff/teaching/develop/york-learning-teaching-award/"> York Learning and Teaching Award</a> (2017-2018), a credit-baring taught course on pedagogic practice for which I received the Outstanding Portfolio Award.</p>
        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>In 2015, during my MA in Women’s Studies, I discovered web design and coding as a means to convey an experience. I taught myself to code HTML and CSS to develop my dissertation as a pseudo-hypertext; my aim was to put the reader in an active role where they had to choose their own path and, in a way, mimic the experience of engaging in the creative practices I was analysing. </p>
        <p>My interest in coding and web design grew and in 2018 I was invited to re-design the website for the Centre for Women’s Studies’ annual conference, which is still being to date, and the following year I took a course in Web Development by Code First Girls where I developed my CSS and Java skills. This was very useful as that same year I was curating an <a href="https://www.notjustblue.co.uk/">art exhibition as part of my PhD research</a> and I was able to design and build my own website.</p>
        <h3>Combining the two</h3>
        <p>In 2021 I reconsidered my career path and decided to shift my course to pursue my passions for pedagogy and technology through a role in the world of Learning Technology. At that point I joined King’s Online and started my journey in E-learning and learning technology.</p>

        <h2>Why I wish to gain CMALT accreditation and how?</h2>
        <p>Achieving my CMALT accreditation is another step in this direction, and a big part of my professional development. Writing this portfolio has helped me review the work I have done in the past few years and reflect on how I want to move forward in the world of learning technology. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="how">
        <h2>... and how this relates to my future career aspirations.</h2>
        <p>
            Being part of the ALT community will allow me to network and share ideas on what is an ever-changing field. I want to continue growing and enhancing my skills and knowledge by attending courses, conferences and workshops. Not only that, but I want to start contributing to those events and be an active part of the learning technology community.
