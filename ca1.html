        <h2>a&#41; An understanding of the constraints and benefits of different technologies.</h2>
        <p>Content Developers build the content on KEATS (King’s Moodle) and develop expertise on the various components and activities available to us. Because of this, I am often asked to advise on the most appropriate component for a specific activity. </p>
        <p>For example, in one of my modules the Learning Designer provided a storyboard for a Moodle book, where the second chapter was a ‘Website tour’ of The Coronavirus Time Capsule website. The chapter included screenshots with their descriptions and accompanying text, but:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There was no sense of structure to the ‘tour’.</li>
            <li>The different focal points blended into each other.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the Learning Designer’s request, I looked at some options. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Provide an accessible solution with a clear structure.</p>

            I came up with three potential solutions: 
        </p>

    </section>
    <section id="boxes">
        <h3>1. Float boxes</h3>
        <p>Presenting the screenshots in float boxes, displaying the images on one side and the accompanying text on the other. </p>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced scrolling.</li>
            <li>The ‘Website tour’ can be kept as a second chapter in the Moodle book. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Drawbacks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The screenshots are too small to study the pages in detail; students would need to refer to the original website.</li>
            <li>The feeling of a ‘tour’ is lost. </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="Carousel">
        <h3>2.	Carousel</h3>
        <p>Putting the images in a carousel with the accompanying text underneath. </p>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimal scrolling.</li>
            <li>The screenshots are shown in full width and the pages can be studied in detail. </li>
            <li>The feeling of a ‘tour’ is maintained. </li>
            <li>The ‘Website tour’ can be kept as a second chapter in the Moodle book. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Drawbacks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://shouldiuseacarousel.com/">Carousels are notorious</a> for being an ineffective way of conveying information. Because a carousel would hide slides from the students, they might miss some of the content. That is why in our Design System (DS) we reserve carousels for activities that require comparing images. </li>
            <li>Because a carousel would hide content, students with certain learning disabilities might struggle to process and retain the information.  </li>

    </section>
    <section id="Book">
        <h3>3.	A Moodle book with chapters</h3>
        <p>Creating a dedicated Moodle book with a chapter for each screenshot. </p>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimal scrolling.</li>
            <li>The screenshots are shown in full width and the pages can be studied in detail. </li>
            <li>The feeling of a ‘tour’ is maintained. </li>
            <li>Our students are used to navigating books with chapters and to view all the chapters. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Drawbacks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The original Moodle book needs to be split so the ‘Website tour’ can be its own book. </li>
        </ul>

                <div class="col-md-11">
                    <p>I felt the best option was to use a separate book for the ‘Website tour’ as it provided a ‘tour’ feel, displayed the images in full width and avoided hiding content from the students, minimising accessibility issues and the chance missing some of the content. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            I presented the options to the Learning Designer, explaining my concerns about using a carousel and the layout issues with the float boxes. Together we decided to create the ‘Website tour’ as a separate book. <strong>(C&D)</strong>

                        <strong>Aurèlia</strong>: Hi [redacted]. I'm playing around in my sandbox re the screenshots of the covid page. I've prepared 4 options: using chapters, a caroussel, float boxes with the description inside, and float boxes with the description outside.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm concerned about the accessibility of carousels, I think we can achieve a similar effect with book chapters. what do you think?</p>
                    <p>Re float boxes, I'm not sure how I feel about them. But I wonder if putting the description outside of them might be an issue accessibility wise, because with a screen reader users will be accessing the description after the paragraph about the image</p>
                    <p>What do you think would work best?</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Learning Designer [redacted]</strong>: Thanks. I think book chapters work the best in my opinion. That would be my preference I think

                        <strong>Aurèlia</strong>: I agree &#128578; I'll make a note in the SB

        <h2>b&#41; Technical knowledge and ability in the use of learning technology.</h2>
        <h3>Programming Languages </h3>
        <p>In 2019, I took part of a <em>CodeFirst: Girls</em> HTML web development course, which supplemented my self-taught knowledge of HTML and CSS and introduced me to Bootstrap and JavaScript. </p>
        <div class="evidence">
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/evidence/CodeFirst Girls certificate.png" alt="Course completion certificate signed Spring 2019." width="75%">
                <figcaption>Figure 2. My <em>CodeFirst: Girls</em> 'HTML web development course' certificate.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>At KO I work predominantly with HTML to create content on Moodle through the Atto editor. We work within a set of templates we call the Design System (DS), which considers user experience, accessibility and universal design to create a cohesive learning experience.</p>
        <div class="definition">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-1">
                  <img src="./images/dictionary.png" alt="" width="50px">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md">
                    <p>The King’s Online Design System is a set of principles, instructions and toolkit for modular, consistent and reusable design used across all of our programmes/courses.</p>
                </div>
        </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Therefore, a lot of my work consists in piecing together different elements of the DS to create cohesive and consistent content. Nonetheless, sometimes I use my knowledge of HTML to find ways of adapting or creating content elements. For example, once I had to add a second author to what we call an academic note. </p>
        <h3>Authoring tools</h3>
        <p>I also have experience using authoring tools such as WordPress, Google Sites and Wix to create websites. The latest example are the educational pages for the <a href="https://www.re-versetheatre.com/education">Hamlet Voyage</a> theatre production (2022).</p>
        <h3>Padlet </h3>
        <p>In 2021 I designed and delivered an undergraduate module at the <em>Universitat de Barcelona </em>(UB). I used Padlet to engage students in online and active learning. I set up a single <a href="https://padlet.com/aup500/an-lisi-de-textos-pbrp5ckusfhmeobi">Padlet board for the whole group</a>where students would share their breakout room’s. We used the same Padlet board over the whole module, changing the background and adding new columns for each new text we analysed. I also set up a <a href="https://padlet.com/aup500/hist-ria-de-les-arts-esc-niques-iv69k9d6qtgj4qcf">Padlet board to share resources</a>.</p>

                    <h4>What went well</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It allowed most students to feel safe enough to participate in the discussion without having to openly speak in front of their peers.  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What I would do differently</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I would not have a single board for the whole module because it becomes too overwhelming as the weeks go by. A single board per reading would make it more effective at delimitating each text analysis.</li>
                        <li>I would not set up a general resources Padlet, instead I would share the resources directly on Moodle. This would minimise the amount of platforms students need to log into and the amount of steps for them to get to the resources.  <strong>(E&U)</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Virtual Learning Environments</h3>
        <p>I have worked with several VLEs, as a student, teacher, administrator and content creator.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Moodle</strong>: as a lecturer at the UB, I used Moodle to post materials, monitor activity completion and make announcements to students. At King’s I create create content directly in Moodle. </li>
            <li><strong>BrightSpace</strong>: as a Senior Officer at the London Institute of Banking and Finance (LIBF), I monitored activity engagement and posted webinar materials. I also ran the final Quality Assurance tests for published content.</li>
            <li><strong>Blackboard</strong>: I used Blackboard as a GTA at the University of York, posting material and moderating blog submissions . </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-11">
                    <p>My experience with previous VLEs meant I was very quick to learn to use Brightspace, and I was able to transfer good practices from one to another. For example, I recognised the value of the clear and recognisable structure to the LIBF modules and apply it to Moodle while working at the UB. </p>

        <p>I also have extensive experience presenting and managing teaching sessions with several conference platforms. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blackboard Collaborate</strong>: delivered synchronous teaching as a lecturer at the UB.</li>
            <li><strong>Zoom</strong>: ran and oversaw the delivery of teaching sessions on Zoom as a Senior Officer. I also set up and managed breakout rooms and polls and ran reports on attendance and participation.</li>
            <li><strong>Teams</strong>: this is the platform I currently use to deliver training and workshops at KO. </li>

                    <p>My work at the LIBF had a major impact on how I use conference platforms now: running the polls and breakout rooms for various lecturers allowed me to see a great range of pedagogical uses of those tools that I have added to my practice:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At the UB I introduced the use of breakout rooms, something the students were not used to. </li>
                        <li>At KO, I use of Team’s forms as quiz questions to add interactivity and active participation. <strong>(LfC)</strong></li>

        <h2>c&#41; Supporting the deployment of learning technologies.</h2>
        <p>At KO I sometimes advise on wider issues that affect more than just a specific activity or module. A good example of this is my work on a language course we were developing, something for which we had no prior experience.</p>
        <p>As I started building the course I was adding foreign language attributes to the extended foreign language content, I wondered what the experience of this material would be like for screen reader (SR) users <strong>(E&U)</strong>. Thus, I took the initiative to learn how to use SR <strong>(KUTD)</strong> and read the material we were creating with several of them (VoiceOver, Narrator and NVDA). This preliminary research uncovered a set of serious issues where SRs did not read the target language (eg. Spanish) with the correct language voice, reading it in English instead. This would have a negative impact on learners using SRs, as they would hear words in the target language pronounced inconsistently throughout the course.</p>
        <p>I raised my findings and worked with the Web Developers to identify the main barriers to SR users we have in KEATS when it comes to language courses. </p>

                    <p>I now know more about accessibility testing and would have taken a more systematised approach, that would have made my evaluation more effective: </p>      
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using just VO and NVDA</li>
                        <li>Setting a testing scope of significant components. </li>
                        <li>Creating a formalised issue log.</li>

        <p>I worked with the Web Developers and identifed the main barriers to SR users in KEATS language courses, but we were unable to fix them because:  </p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Different SRs encounter different issues – fixing something for a particular SR might create issues for another.</li>
            <li>Issues depend on SR-browser combinations and their version. Even if we manged to fix the issues we had identified, new and old issues could appear with a browser’s update. (García, 2020) </li>
        </ol>

            <div class="row" id="reflexio">

                  <img src="./images/reflexio.png" alt="Reflection" width="50px">

                <div class="col-md-11">
                    <p>Finding the symptoms but not the cause, and thus not being able to offer a true solution was quite frustrating. Moreover, although realising that this is a know issue was somewhat reassuring, it was also discouraging to find that even within assistive technology such barriers continue exist despite decades of development in AT and browsers. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Instead, we came up with a set of guidelines to avoid these known issues with SR and multilingual content <strong>(C&D)</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Do not include the target language in radio buttons</strong> (e.g., in MCQ) or <strong>dropdown options</strong>. This is because some SR fail to detect the language attribute of content in the radio buttons and dropdown options. We can include the target language in Gap Fill questions.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not include spelling mistakes in the target language</strong> on answer options: SRs cannot make the distinction between correctly and incorrectly spelled options.</li>
            <li><strong>For audio comprehension tests, use a Gap Fill question</strong>. In the question description include the audio and the ordered answer options (i.e., a, b, c) and ask the students to type in the letter corresponding to the correct answer in the provided space.</li>
            <li>When using Gap Fill questions, include <strong>maximum three gaps per question</strong>. This is because feedback on more than three gaps can become very verbose and confusing.</li>
            <li>When using Gap Fill questions, only have <strong>one gap per text unit</strong> (e.g., one gap per sentence or paragraph). Try to place the gap at the end of the textual unit. This is because in the feedback, SRs partition the text based on the gap, not punctuation, which can be confusing if we include more than one gap per text unit .</li>
        </ul>
