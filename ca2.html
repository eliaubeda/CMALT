        <h2>a&#41; An understanding of teaching, learning and/or assessment processes</h2>
        <p>While doing my PhD research I took part in the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/staff/teaching/develop/york-learning-teaching-award/">York Learning and Teaching Award</a>(YLTA), a taught course to reflect on and develop pedagogical practice . Through this course I developed a pedagogical understanding of my teaching practice and became an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. This was the beginning of an intense learning journey that continues to this day.</p>
        <p>In 2020/2021 I designed and delivered a second-year undergraduate module at the <em>Universitat de Barcelona</em> (UB) on the history of theatre. When designing the course, my main concern was to effectively incorporate Active Learning into my lessons in an online environment (see in <a href="./ca1.html">CA1</a>).</p>
    </section>
    <section id="active learning">
        <h3>Incorporating Active Learning</h3>
        <p>Active learning encompasses a wide range of pedagogical practices that encourage learners to work with concepts, engaging in higher order thinking and deep learning to actively build their own knowledge and understanding (Biggs and Tang, 2011; Brame, 2016). </p>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">
                <div class="col-sm-1 refle-pic">
                  <img src="./images/reflexio.png" alt="Reflection" width="50px">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-11">
                    <p>My approach to education is shaped by my ongoing feminist commitment, which I apply to my work, life and pedagogy. In a nutshell, to me feminism is an active fight against all forms of discrimination and exploitation, which is why I endeavour to make my workplace and my work as inclusive as possible. As a feminist educator, I prioritise a student-centred teaching practice to empower students to develop their learning and skills. <strong>(E&U)</strong>  As an extension of this, empathy plays a big role in how I approach my work. When planning for the UB course, I pulled from my own experience as a UB alumna and knew that the students would have next to no experience in Active  Learning within the classroom. To this date, there is no pre-class reading, no in-class activities and no in-class active engagement. I experienced a cultural shock when doing my MA in Women’s Studies in the UK: all knowledge acquisition was done through preparatory readings and learning sessions were exclusively guided discussions with our lecturers. Although it was a steep learning curve, I quickly realised that my MA learning was deeper and more meaningful than that of my undergraduate studies. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Nonetheless, I have also seen the pitfalls of Student Lead Learning approach that disregards students’ prior knowledge and level of expertise (Kirschner and Hendrick, 2020a, 2020b). As a GTA in History of Art (UoY), I lead a course where students were expected to describe and analyse artworks without any prior contextual knowledge acquisition. </p>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">
                <div class="col-sm-1 refle-pic">
                  <img src="./images/reflexio.png" alt="Reflection" width="50px">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-11">
                    The students in that module (for all GTAs) struggled to engage meaningfully with the artworks. This was because we were asking students to work with and apply concepts we had not introduced or explained to them. This experience made me realise the importance of providing students with a solid knowledge base (via readings or lectures) to later apply into deeper learning. 
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Because of experience as both a teacher and a student, I wanted to incorporate the pedagogy I had learnt in the UK <strong>(LfC)</strong> to the lecture-based teaching my students would be used to <strong>(E&U)</strong>. I wanted to:</p>        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Combine reception learning with active learning. </strong></p>
                <p>Dividing the sessions in two parts: a short lecture to provide contextual knowledge and a breakout room activity to analyse a theatrical text.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Adjust the students’ expectations and make mine very clear.</strong></p>
                <p>I adjusted the students’ expectations for the module: I wouldn’t just provide them information, but I would give them a short pre-reading task for them to analyse collaboratively in-class.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Create a safe space where students felt confident to share their views.</strong> </p>
                <p>To build up their confidence, I asked students to work in small breakout rooms and share the group’s thoughts in a Padlet (see CA 1). Students could share their thoughts anonymously without the pressure of speaking in front of me (the lecturer) or their peers. We still came together for whole-group discussion but if there were no volunteers from a given group, I would comment on their anonymous contributions. <strong>(E&U)</strong></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There was a short period of transition as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This was the first time they were asked to contribute to class and share their opinions.</li>
            <li>They were not used to preparatory reading and some students did not do the reading for the first few sessions. I asked students if they had read the material and encouraged them to be honest, so I could group students effectively.   </li>
            <li>For many of them this was their first time using breakout rooms. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Moreover, I had not foreseen that the university-provided laptops did not have a webcam or microphone and I had to quickly provide instructions on how to join using a phone. </p>

                <div class="col-md-11">
                    <p>I was not satisfied with the phone-in solution as it could potentially add a financial burden to students, particularly because it only affected those who depended on the university-provided laptops and thus might be at an economic disadvantage. Unfortunately, that was a limitation of Blackboard Collaborate which, unlike Teams or Zoom, did not offer the option to receive a call to join.</p>      
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>After a few sessions of adaptation, the students became more engaged in the analysis and generally came prepared to class. </p>

                    </p>
                        <p>Good afternoon, Aurèlia,</p>
                        <p>In case my name doesn't ring a bell, I'm the crazy one from <span lang="ca">Història de les arts escèniques</span>, UB, that writes to you in English.</p>
                        <p>I only wanted to thank you for your inspiring tuition during Toni's paternity leave. Your methodology was so new to us (UB is not an online university and things like Padlet, for example, are completely out of the question, I'm afraid). Moreover, your insisting on our reading a text, previous to each class, implied more effort on our part, of course, but naturally also a better understanding, derived from our briefly peeping into each play, and individually thinking about it before putting our heads together in the classroom groups you created (which were also very rewarding, in a personal and social way, since classroom relationships were cut short by Covid conditions).</p>
                        <p>That's all, I don't want to take more of your time than is necessary, but I felt I had to tell you how much I enjoyed your classes, and thank you accordingly. I wish you all the success you deserve, in whatever you do in life. Thanks for everything.</p>
                        <p>All the best,</p>
                        <p>[Redacted]</p>
                        <p>P.S. <span lang="ca">I bones vacances</span>,</p>

        <h3>Designing a course</h3>
        <p>For this module, I was given three Teaching Objectives. There is a significant difference between TOs and LOs: while the former state what the teacher plans to achieve, the later state what the students should achieve (Kennedy, 2007; Williamson, n. d.). Wanting to deliver a more student-centred teaching, I devised new LOs that would shift the perspective from my teaching to the students’ learning and that could be assessed.</p>
        <p>To convert the TOs into LOS, I considered: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What can students do with that knowledge?</li>
            <li>How will the knowledge be assessed?</li>
        </ul>

                    <p><strong>How will the knowledge be assessed? </strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Can they name the key technological advances in the relevant time period?</strong> Falling in the ‘Understand’ category of Bloom’s taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001). </p>

                            <p><strong>Can they explain their impact on the development of theatrical arts?</strong> Falling in the ‘Analyse’ category of Bloom’s taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001).</p>

                    <p>In hindsight, although the LOs were effective and helped me design the course, I should have also taken into account the assessment when selecting relevant texts for the students to analyse. The assessed was split between a podcast-essay and an exam – neither of which I marked. The exam questions were only set four weeks in advance at my request, but the podcast-essay questions were handed to each student ¬at the beginning of the term. If I had taken into consideration those essay questions I would have been able to align my content better and prevent some confusion that later arose for students with ambiguous questions. <strong>(KUTD)</strong></p>

        <h3>Accessibility workshops</h3>
        <p>In September 2022 I restarted the Accessibility workshops series at King’s Online. Accessibility is a key quality value at KO, but we hadn’t had a workshop on it since March 2021. The aim is to keep our accessibility knowledge relevant and up-to-date, as well as sharing our concerns and best practices <strong>(C&D, LfC)</strong>.</p>
        <p>Colleagues from different roles attend the workshops with different perspectives, aims and needs. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>General knowledge.</strong></p>
                <p>Those interacting with faculty and working with the first drafts of the content need a general understanding of the principles of web accessibility to identify issues early on and address them with faculty members.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Specific knowledge.</strong></p>
                <p>Those building the content and uploading it on Moodle need specific and technical knowledge on how to meet standards. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I balance these perspectives when designing workshops. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="example">
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>I ran two very different workshops on the same topic: UK legal requirements for accessibility in HE.</p>
        <h5>For the build team</h5>
        <p>This informal session was for my immediate team (content developers and visual designers). I went over highlighted sections of the UK Accessibility Regulations with my colleagues, summarising and clarifying them and their significance for our work. </p>
        <p>When covering the WCAG 2.1 standards, I used the WCAG website to explain their structure and conformance levels. Because the build team need to know and apply the technical requirements when coding and doing Quality Assurance, I went over each WCAG Guideline and covered in detail a few relevant Success Criteria. <strong>(C&D)</strong></p>
        <h5>For the whole KO team</h5>
        <p>For this session I summarised the relevant legal points and supported them with quotes from government guidance and King’s accessibility statement. Aiming to keep learners engaged, I included a break-out room exercise where I asked them to consider how a module lead might help a student facing learning barriers due to inaccessible technology. <strong>(C&D, KUTD)</strong></p>

                    <p>I was quite worried the session for the wider team would be too dry and boring. From the feedback I received, I believe I was successful in explaining the legal requirements from KO’s perspective and work processes in a simple and engaging way.</p>

                    <p>This unstructured approach with no firm outcomes or deadlines did not work well because the ELCD role is very specific:</p>

                        <li>Building content in HTML.</li>
                        <li>Doing BQA on other ELCD’s work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So there weren’t that many interests from the mentee to address through informal discussion. </p>

        <p>After seeking advice, I re-thought the mentorship as a scalable project with a clear and assessable Learning Outcome <strong>(LfC)</strong>: '•	By the end of the mentorship, learners will have built a KEATS space following the King’s Online Design System (DS) with examples of the most common components and activities.'</p>

                    <li><p>Create mock content for mentees to BQA with an accompanying log of issues in it. </p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p>Designed a mock module for mentees to build content. The module has three units, scaffolding the components from most to least used and by difficulty. <strong>(E&U)</strong></p></li>
