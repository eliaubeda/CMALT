    <section id="a">
        <h2>a&#41; Understanding and engaging with legislation</h2>
        <p>Digital accessibility is one of my key professional and ethical values and has been the area where I have learnt the most since I started in my new role at King’s Online. When I joined the team, I had a very limited understanding of what digital accessibility meant – I knew what an alt text was, understood some colour combinations were better for readability and how important captions are on videos. </p>
        <p>It came as a bit of a shock to realise how much digital accessibility encompassed. Learning about the accessibility quality assurance processes at KO was revealing, as it forced me to confront my ableist practices and consider how I was and had been building and its impact on users with various (dis)abilities. </p>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">
                <div class="col-sm-1 refle-pic ">
                  <img src="./images/reflexio.png" alt="Reflection" width="50px">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-11">
                    <p>My political and moral commitment to feminism shapes my personal and professional practice. I share bell hook’s understanding of feminism as ‘a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression’(hooks, 2014, p.xii), extending it to include oppressive systems more widely in recognition of the intersectional character of oppression and discrimination (Crenshaw, 1991). Nonetheless, I had clearly overlooked ableism in my efforts. Therefore, I decided to make accessibility a priority in my work and learn how my professional practice affected others and how to be as inclusive as possible in my work.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I set out to learn more about accessibility standards, taking LinkedIn Learning courses on accessibility, joining Jisc mailing lists and the ALT SIG, and took a Deque course on Accessibility Quality Assurance Testing, through which I gained a thorough understanding of the WCAG standards and the UK legislation  <strong>(E&U, KUTD)</strong>.  </p>
        <p>Learning about the <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA</strong> I was able to understand the reasoning behind some procedures we had in place at KO and identify areas for improvement such as colour contrast in graphics, the importance of testing with Assistive Technology and the inclusion of audio description for multimedia and video content. </p>
        <p>Learning about <strong>The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018</strong> has helped me convey the importance of digital accessibility to colleagues and management in KO <strong>(C&D)</strong>. When considering accessibility, we need to balance different perspectives: the business needs, the ethical and moral implications and the legal requirements. At KO we have a good grasp of the ethical duty towards our students in relation to accessibility, but sometimes practicalities or business needs will trump accessibility concerns. With a good understanding of the legislation, I can confidently argue when content fails the required WCAG 2.1 AA standards and constructively question the decision of adding inaccessible content <strong>(C&D)</strong>. This is important to assess whether such instances constitute disproportionate burden, as set out by legislation, or if we are failing the standards set out. </p>
        <p>I continue to learn about digital accessibility, with a focus on how to create accessible content, and share my knowledge with my colleagues through presentations, workshops, and writing up guidance <strong>(C&D)</strong>. I also endeavour to have an open mind and to listen to my colleagues’ concerns and perspectives when we talk about accessibility <strong>(LfC)</strong>; knowing the standards, it is easy to take a simplistic fail/pass view on accessibility concerns. But accessibility is a world of nuance and complexity, where a component might be accessible for some or not others, and we need to consider the learning experience of all our students to achieve a feasible balance.  </p>
        <p>I will cover this in more detail in my Specialist Area section, but below is an example where the build team at KO considered the experience of all our students to reach a decision on accessibility.</p>

    <section id="deco-images">
        <h3>Decorative images</h3>
        <p>Until November 2022 the guidance at KO established that decorative images should be marked with an empty alt attribute, following digital best practice. During a build team meeting, I raised my concerns around this practice within KEATS (King’s Moodle). </p>
        <div class="steps">
            <div class="step">

                    <h4>The problem</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="step-content">
                    <p>When an image source broke KEATS would display a broken image icon and its alt text. In the case of decorative images with an empty alt, KEATS would display the file’s name, which could be confusing for sighted student who might be left wondering if they were missing valuable content. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="connect">
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down"></i>

                    <p>Adding an alt text to decorative images and marking them as decorative with the ARIA role="presentation". </p>

                            <h5>Pros</h5>
                            <p>This would ensure:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>the images are not announced unnecessarily to screen-reader users</li>
                                <li>if the images break, sighted users see a description of the image or a note saying ‘Decorative image’ informing them that they are not missing any valuable content.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </div>

                            <h5>Cons</h5>
                            <p>Not all screen readers support role="presentation" thus guidance encourages the use of empty alt instead. (Initiative (WAI), 2019).</p>

                        </div>
                      
                      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                      <p>The build team considered that following current digital accessibility best practice could be detrimental to most of our students, whereas using role=”presentation” with an alt text had very minimal chances of affecting any of our students as it is supported by the most widely used screen readers. </p>

                <h4>The decision</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="step-content">
                <p>The build team changed the KO guidance on decorative images:</p>
                <p>Decorative images should have an alt text and role=”presentation” so that they are not announced by screen readers and sighted users know it was a non-essential image if the image breaks.</p>           
            </div>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Further considerations</h4>
        <p>Since the change in guidance, KEATS has changed how it displays broken images: it displays as if there was no image unless there is an alt text. Therefore, with the old guidance any broken images would not display; users and testers would not have known there is a broken image unless they are aware that it should be there making quality assurance more difficult. </p>

        <p>In both my personal and professional live I am committed to challenging discrimination and promoting social justice. This aligns with King’s Equality Diverstiy and Inclusion policy, which goes beyond the The Equality Act 2010 in its understanding of diversity to ‘include everything that makes us unique, from our backgrounds and experiences to our personalities and ways of thinking’(King’s College London, 2020, p.2). Within King’s, we are all ‘responsible for meeting these commitments to value diversity and create an inclusive environment’(King’s College London, 2020, p.2). I take this responsibility seriously and apply my commitment to it at work through my personal development and my practice.   </p>
        <p>On an individual level, I stay informed of the university’s initiatives and events regarding gender, race and inclusion, and I attend whenever I can. </p>

        <h3>Racist language</h3>
        <p>Although the Quality Assurance I perform focus on functionality and digital accessibility and I am not required to read through the content, sometimes I skim over the text. In some of those occasions I have spotted problematic language, like a module that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>referred to black people as ‘Blacks’, Hispanic people as ‘Hispanics’ and white people as ‘Whites’.</p>
                <p>Using racial and ethnic terms as nouns instead of adjectives is generally discouraged as it reduces people’s identity to how they are racialised (‘Writing about ethnicity’, n.d.; Bristol, n.d.). However, using the adjective (e.g. Black people) denotes that it is a diverse group of people that share a particular characteristic and is thus more inclusive and less reductionist.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>capitalised the descriptive adjective ‘black’.</p>

                        <div class="col-md-11">
                            <p>Since I raised this issue, I have learnt that some people, particularly in the US context, prefer capitalising the words ‘black’ and ‘white’ when referring to an ethnicity. I nonetheless agree with Dabiri when she notes that capitalising racial terms serves to perpetuate the labels invented around whiteness and white supremacy (Dabiri, 2021). In future, I would ask if the capitalisation is intentional and constructively question if it is purposeful in its context. </p>

In the first few lines black people are referred to as 'Blacks', hispanic people as '‘Hispanics’ and white people as '‘Whites’.

              <p>In one of our modules, the concept of domicile – which derives from Roman law – was illustrated with an example from ancient Rome.

              <p>In a project meeting I brought up that this was an inaccurate way of presenting history that perpetuates the idea that Spain and Britain are long-standing national identities and thus to the sense of eternal empire that has been (and continues to be) so harmful <strong>(C&D)</strong>. </p>
              <p>My advice was taken on board and we rewrote the example to talk of a legionnaire from Tarraco being sent to Britannia. Unfortunately, the Module Lead rejected our suggestions and the amendments were not incorporated to the final product.</p>

        <h3>Appropriate terminology and inclusive language</h3>
        <p>Using accurate terminology is particularly important in medical contexts (Linfield, 2019). In lesson about HIV, we were using gender terms (man/woman) to refer to biological sex, which in some instances would mean we were not accounting for the trans and nonbinary community. This is a relevant point as some research suggests trans people (particularly trans women) are at higher risk (Samuel, 2022).

                 <p><strong>Aurèlia</strong>: Hi [Redacted] just wondering: gender (man/boy) refers to identity rather than biological sex. Here, do we mean to say male sex instead? </p>
                  <p><strong>Learning Designer</strong>: Yes @Ubeda Puigdomenech, Aurelia I agree that makes sense to change. FYI [Module Lead] we will need to follow the definition of gender as social and sex as biological as given on the WHO site: https://www.who.int/health-topics/gender#tab=tab_1. Let me know if any issues with that in this context though. Thanks!</p>
                  <p><strong>Module Lead</strong>: I do agree, [Learning Designer].Sex rather than gender here please. An error in the original!</p>
                  <p><strong>Learning Designer</strong>: Many thanks [Module Lead], @Ubeda Puigdomenech, Aurelia please go ahead</p>

                <p><strong>Aurèlia</strong>: Hi [Learning Designer] I was wondering if we could make this a bit more inclusive. This might be a bit nitpicky but I think is important. I worry that by saying men and women, we are not accounting for the trans and non- binary community. This might be relevant as some research suggests trans people (particularly trans women) are at higher risk. Again, I wonder if it might be more accurate to refer to sex rather than gender: "through unprotected sexual intercourse including a male partner (this is the most common means of HIV transmission).". I took inspiration from the CDC's website: https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/men/index.html</p>
                <p><strong>Learning Designer</strong>: Thanks @Ubeda Puigdomenech, Aurelia I've suggested some changes. I don't think 'including a male partner' is quite clear enough so I've stolen a phrase the CDC use. [Module Lead] can you let us know (when back from your holiday!) if you're OK with this change or if you suggest something different?</p>
                <p><strong>Learning Designer</strong>: Or we could say something like 'unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected partner, particularly where one partner is male (this is the most common means of HIV transmission'.</p>
                <p><strong>Module Lead</strong>: I think the proposed alteration is appropriate, and I am happy with it.</p>
