        </div>
      <section id="intro">
        <p>As an E-Learning Content Developer I work as part of a wider team, and I coordinate and communicate with colleagues on all sorts of matters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Production of modules</li>
            <li>Coordinating projects</li>
            <li>Sharing knowledge and best practice</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="production">
        <h2>Production of modules</h2>
        <p>On any given project, I work with a Project Manager, a Learning Designer, a Visual Designer and an E-Learning Assistant. </p>
        <h3>Trello</h3>
        <p>We use Trello to manage our projects, where we have a board for each project with a column of tasks for each module’s week. When I finish a task, I add the relevant information on the card and tag the colleague who next needs to work on the activity. For example, after building a discussion forum, I will add a link to the discussion forum and tag the Learning Designer so they can check (QA) the build. </p>
        <h3>Excel sheets</h3>
        <p>When checking each other’s work, we make notes of any issues in an Excel-based QA log, where it’s important to be clear and specific about the issues found and potential solutions. A spreadsheet allows us to have an overview of all the issues in a single project and have extended discussions on particular issues without muddling the Trello cards. </p>
        <p>These QA logs are the same ones we use when ELCDs do QA checks on each other’s work, which were a very useful tool to learn about my role when I join the team: after noting down issues in my fellow ELCDs’ work, they would kindly reply to my notes in the Excel sheet explaining how they fixed things or why some of the issues I had identified were not  mistakes. </p>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">
                <div class="col-sm-1 refle-pic">
                  <img src="./images/reflexio.png" alt="Reflection" width="50px">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-11">
                <p>I continue in that best practice, so when I do QA for a fellow ELCD, I am always mindful of the tone I use to foster a friendly work environment and acknowledge that we are sharing our opinions, not dictating solutions. For example, instead of saying ‘there needs to be more spacing between these two bits’, I would write ‘I think we need more spacing between these two bits for consistency across the unit?’. I also continue to reply to fellow ELCD’s comments on my work in the same way my seniors did for me, to keep a record of it and share best practice, particularly with new colleagues.</p>      
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Slack</h3>
        <p>At King’s Online, we use Slack for most of our written communications: announcements, general questions, direct messaging, and sharing knowledge. Each project – encompassing a range of modules – has a dedicated Slack channel where we update the rest of the team and can discuss arising issues. This is where I communicate any wider issues we find in a module that would affect other modules in the same project. </p>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">
                <div class="col-sm-1 refle-pic">
                  <img src="./images/reflexio.png" alt="Reflection" width="50px">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-11">
                <p>One of the downsides of the way we use Slack, is that we tend to have private conversations with other team members about some module or project-specific issues. These conversations are not visible to the whole team, so they:</p>      
                <ul>
                    <li>Are not aware of them</li>
                    <li>Cannot learn from our experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the recent months, we have been pushing for having these conversations in the relevant Slack channels. This is a slow cultural change, but it makes it much easier to retrieve information and learn from each other in a hybrid environment.</p>

      <section id="projects">
        <h2>Coordinating projects</h2>
        <p>I also work closely with my fellow ELCDs on other, team-specific projects, such as consolidating our ways of working. Because we mainly work from home, there is little opportunity to see each other work and learn from observing our colleagues. This meant we were all working differently with different tools to achieve the same results within our Design System  parameters. </p>
        <div class="definition">

        <br>
        <p>Realising that I knew of some tools that my colleagues were not aware of, I organised a meeting for ELCDs to share any tips, tools, and/or best practices we have when building our content. It proved to be a very productive meeting where we all learnt from each other and came to some decisions for our building processes, mainly that I would share my collection of code snippets with the rest of the team. </p>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">
                <div class="col-sm-1 refle-pic">
                  <img src="./images/reflexio.png" alt="Reflection" width="50px">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-11">
                <p>It was very interesting hearing how we all work, noting difference and similarities. We all had tips and tools that were useful to the whole team, which reinforced my conviction in collaborative learning and knowledge sharing at work. It was in that meeting that I learnt of the coding plug-in Emmet, which I now use on a daily basis.</p>      
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>We decided I would set up a GitHub repository where I would add my snippets and all ELCDs could download on their computers, add new snippets to it and make edits. This has made our build consistent and more efficient and enabled conversations around how we use bits of code . Because we can all make changes to the snippets file, it’s important that we communicate on Slack any changes that we have made and alert colleagues to update the files on their computers. </p>

                <p>We are all still learning how to best use GitHub and sometimes we override each other’s work – there is still room to improve our process to make the most out of our GitHub repository. </p>

        <h2>Sharing knowledge and best practice</h2>
        <h3>Internally</h3>
        <p>At KO we emphasize sharing knowledge and best practice. The main medium we use is Slack –¬ with dedicated channels for different teams and issues – where we ask questions, reply to others and share things we have learnt. Using Slack has some sound advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Asking questions publicly in a channel means everyone else can see it and learn from it. </li>
            <li>We can easily search old queries and posts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, our team of developers have a channel where they post all the open bug tickets, which allows me to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>See issues my colleagues have found and reported, so we don’t duplicate tickets.</li>
            <li>Know when tickets are resolved regardless of whether I logged them or not.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">

                <div class="col-md-11">
                    <p>When posting, I need to be purposeful in my use of words to make sure I am clear but also that the information can be easily found. I don’t always do that and it can be hard to find specific threads I can remember reading.</p>      
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I also give presentations and workshops to my colleagues to share my knowledge of accessibility (<a href="./ca2.html">see CA 2</a>); and I write guidance on accessibility issues and on how to use project management tools we develop.    When writing the guidance, I try to be as clear and specific as possible, working with the assumption that the reader have a very limited knowledge of the tools I refer too. </p>

                <div class="col-md-11">
                <p>This is something I learnt from my work at the London Institute of Banking and Finance, where my colleague Greta created very thorough guidance on our processes which made my onboarding fast and smooth. </p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Externally</h3>
        <p>ELCDs don’t normally engage directly with member of faculty, but there are instances where I leave comments in our story boards that will be addressed by them (<a href="./ca3.html">see CA 3</a>). </p>

                    <p><strong>Aurèlia</strong>: hi [Learning Designer] Just a query about the alt text. I think the image shouldn't be marked as decorative as it reinforces the textual content with an example. I think the alt text would make more sense if: a) it specifies that it is a black woman holding the sign, and b) we change black to blackie as 'negrita' doesn't simply mean black it's the diminutive (and pejorative) for a black woman.</p>                        
                    <p><strong>Learning Designer</strong>: Aurelia, happy to (a) add black women, and (b) I wonder if we would be better to just have what is on the card, ie "Mi nombre no es negrita." and let students translate if they choose to.</p>
                    <p><strong>Aurèlia</strong>: Hi [Learning Designer] I like that :) </p>

        <p>Externally to King’s, I stay up to date by attending workshops and webinars and through my subscriptions to various JISC mailing lists, the ALT newsletter and that of WebAIM. As part of my career development, I want to participate more actively with the JISC mailing lists, contributing to threads and asking questions to learn about practices outside of King’s.   This will allow me to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contribute to the improvement of our community’s practice</li>
            <li>Develop a network of contacts within the wider learning technology community. </li>
