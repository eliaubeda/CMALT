      <section id="intro">
        <p>When I decided to shift my career focus towards Learning Technology and digital learning, I had very little awareness and understanding of digital accessibility. It has since become one of my areas of expertise: my colleagues ask for my opinion on various accessibility issues, I create guidance and I train my colleagues.  </p>

                <h2>A learning journey</h2>
                <p>In my workshops, I use the analogy of climbing a mountain when describing the journey of learning about accessibility: one day we are told we must climb Mount Accessibility. At first, we might think we’re in good shape and we can reach the top with just a little bit of effort. But as we start the climbing, we realise it’s much bigger and steeper than we thought. Our confidence might faulter as we start to think there’s no way we can reach the top, but we must climb Mount Accessibility (it’s an imperative goal). What is important to remember is that we are not alone climbing. Yes, it can be a steep learning curve, but we’re all learning and sharing knowledge within HE: we help each other find our footing and with each step we take we’re setting up anchoring lines for those behind us . </p>

                    <p>Although I use the analogy of a mountain, in accessibility there is no end destination: it is an ongoing journey of learning and developing in an ever-changing landscape. I illustrate this to my colleagues by being open about my knowledge gaps and my learning journey. </p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>My accessibility journey started before I was even aware of Mount Accessibility. When creating digital material, I tried to create it for the target users/audience and considered the readability of the text, the clarity of the layout and how easy it would be to navigate.</p>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">
                <div class="col-sm-1 refle-pic">

                <p>This came from my ongoing feminist commitment, which I apply to my work, life and pedagogy (see CA1). When coding content, I use my empathy to approach my work and think of how the reader will interact with the material. <strong>(E&U)</strong></p>

        <p>Before I joined King’s Online, I had very little awareness about accessibility requirements: I knew that images should have descriptions in the alt text and had a vague notion that colour contrast was important for readability. Even so, looking back on my old work, it was surprisingly accessible thanks to putting my users/readers at the centre of my design and following coding best practice.</p>
        <p>I first realised there was a ‘Mount Accessibility’ when I joined King’s Online and saw all the accessibility requirements we were testing for that I had never considered before. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leaving alt text empty for decorative images</li>
            <li>Providing descriptions when the alt text is too long</li>
            <li>Using a logical heading structure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At that point I felt I was at the foot of a hill, ready to go for a hike and learn a bit about accessibility. During this time, I learnt a lot through my practice, especially through our Quality Assurance process. Checking my colleagues’ work for accessibility issues normalised the fact that we all make mistakes in this area.</p>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">
                <div class="col-sm-1 refle-pic">
                <img src="./images/reflexio.png" alt="Reflection" width="50px">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-11">
                    <p>Still today this deep engagement with my colleagues’ work allows me to learn from their mistakes as well as my own, and make note of things I notice in others’ work that I would not have thought to check in my own work: it’s easier to spot faults in others than in ourselves . <strong>(LfC)</strong></p>            
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I also asked my colleagues for advice and clarification, particularly our Instructional Technology and Product Development Manager, who was our unofficial accessibility expert. But when they left KO, we had a knowledge gap in the team, and I could no longer get answers to the questions and obstacles I encountered on my way up Mount Accessibility. So I decided to take a course on Accessibility QA Testing, which gave me a better understanding of the WCAG guidelines and how they relate to our processes at work: I was finding my footing in Mount Accessibility. <strong>(E&U)</strong></p>
        <p>But as I kept learning and climbed higher up the mountain, I realised Mount Accessibility is much higher a mountain than I anticipated (in fact, not a mountain at all), with many challenging paths. There was much more to learn than I thought, and I came to understand how important it was for KO to maintain the good work started by our previous Instructional Technology and Product Development Manager: we had to carry on putting accessibility at the forefront of our work and keep it as one of our core values. <strong>(KUTD)</strong></p>
        <p>With that in mind, I set out to restart our Accessibility workshops to keep accessibility relevant and present in my team and department, and to share my knowledge so I could help others up Mount Accessibility.</p>

        <h2>Applying the learning</h2>
        <p>A lot of the learning in this journey also comes through my practice, as new knowledge allows me to analyse my work more in-depth. </p>
        <h3>Assistive technology</h3>
        <p>Knowing how to use screen readers and keyboard navigation, I sometimes test content that I’ve built using just my keyboard or a screen reader. I do this specially when I’m building something a bit out of the ordinary or we are trying a new creative solution with our already tested tools. Doing this I have detected some accessibility issues that would otherwise have slipped by. <strong>(E&U)</strong></p>
        <p>The most impactful discovery I made was in our language courses – our first venture into language teaching. When I tested the Spanish lessons I built, I realised the screen reader sometimes read the target language (Spanish) with an English voice and accent. </p>
        <p>Some of the issues were:</p>

        <h3>Testing for accessibility</h3>
        <p>Because of our universal design and accessibility-first approach, at KO we build on our available tech tools based on their accessibility: we don’t incorporate a tool unless we know it is accessible. After my training on Web Accessibility Testing I applied my learning to create a bespoke Accessibility evaluation methodology for KO to test new tools. It includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An Accessibility Evaluation Excel spreadsheet with all the relevant tests and a summary sheet compiling the relevant figures, such as total number of issues or what areas are most affected.</li>
            <li>An Evaluation Plan Template explaining each step of the evaluation process and the reasoning behind them, so that the plan can be adapted as technology and standards evolve. </li>
            <li>A Report Template clarifying what should be included in a report.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="reflexio">
            <div class="row" id="reflexio">
                <div class="col-sm-1 refle-pic">
                  <img src="./images/reflexio.png" alt="Reflection" width="50px">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-11">
                    <p>After using the methodology to test a new potential VLE, I adapted it to test quiz question types in Moodle. I then realised how tool-specific each evaluation is, as deciding the scope of testing (what material we test) involves understanding the tool/platform analysed and how it will be used at KO. For example, identifying content that will be most used, repeating content, or content most likely to present issues .</p>

        <h3>Small solutions</h3>
        <p>As I continue learning about accessibility, I find new practices to improve. Many of them are small and easy changes that slowly improve our overall accessibility. For example, I learnt  that empty header cells (<th>) in html tables can create barriers to screen reader users, so I flagged how we should use normal cell types (<td>) for empty corner cells in tables with row and column headers. Unfortunately, our CSS code at the time made the empty corner cell stand out, so our Web Developers modified the code so that empty cells in a header are visually undistinguishable from header cells. This means screen reader users have a reliable table without any impact on the table’s visual appearance (see figure 3.). </p>

                        <p><strong>[Redacted]</strong>: Heelloo @elcd! [Redacted] and [redacted] have kindly updated a table setting which means we can now code empty header cells (eg here) as <td> rather than <th> and they will still visually appear grey, as long as they are contained within <thead>. This means that screenreaders won't treat them as a <th> when reading through the <tbody> content and pause for over an empty cell. Thanks @Aurèlia (ELCD) for the BQA feedback which prompted the change &#128516;!</p>

        <p>These are usually things I pick up through my research and reading of blogs and guidance, and I make a point of revisiting guidance such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/">W3C’s tutorials</a> to make sure I stay up-to-date and I don’t fall into bad habits.</p>
        <h3>Participating in discussions</h3>
        <p>I also engage in accessibility discussions we have at our accessibility Slack channel, combining my knowledge in pedagogy and accessibility to find balanced solutions to our needs. </p>
        <p>Being an active member in the accessibility slack channel helps me be aware of what accessibility issues we are finding in the department and where we have knowledge gaps, which in turn feed into the workshops I deliver. </p>
        <p>Although I’m not an active participant, I also read the discussions that take place in the wider community, particularly the Digital Accessibility Regulations JISCMail list. </p>

        <h2>Engaging with my colleagues</h2>
        <p>Sharing my knowledge with the build team – my immediate colleagues – has been key to my accessibility learning. Although I have been the main lead in accessibility initiatives and my professional development has placed me as an accessibility specialist within the team, all accessibility considerations and decisions within the build team take place as a whole-team discussion. This is an important part of our knowledge-sharing, collaborative learning approach and the betterment of our content: by discussing issues and deciding on solutions together, we achieve more considered and reliably accessible practices. </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, because I have been leading the workshops, my clear interest in accessibility and I actively participate in accessibility discussions in our Slack channel, the wider KO team has come to see me as the ‘accessibility expert’. This has brought around some challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Managers from outside the team, have put unreasonable expectations on me. This has been exacerbated by the fact that we currently have an interim manager that is still getting to know how we function as a team. </li>
            <li>Management have started expanding their understanding of my and my colleague’s Content Developer role beyond its job description. This is prompting a discussion around pay grade and responsibilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But this has also brought opportunities. The spotlight the build team has put on accessibility through the workshops and raising awareness through our daily work has brought accessibility to the forefront of our senior leadership team. They are now looking to formalise our guidelines and embed accessibility – not just digital accessibility – within the other teams to a similar degree as we have done in the build team . </p>
